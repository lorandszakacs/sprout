# Contributing

For now we're winging it with issues and feature requests. Start up a discussion and we'll take it from there!

## building project locally

Java 8+, recommended to install via [`sdkman`](https://sdkman.io/) which can then also install sbt for you.
You'll ao need [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to run tests on ScalaJS locally.

## the future

Hopefully we'll provide a nice [nix shell](https://nixos.org), especially when we add the website.
